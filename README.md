- [*Sorting algorithms in C*](https://github.com/austinyu/CSC301-sorting)
  - Implementation of recursive and iterative merge sort, Tim sort, radix sort, bucket sort, and insertion sort.  
  - Runtime of different sorting algorithms are put into competition to compare runtime complexity. 

- [*AVL Trees in Scheme*](https://github.com/austinyu/CSC301-AVL-Tree) 
  - Implementation of balanced AVL tree in functional programming language Scheme. 
  - The height of balanced trees and unbalanced trees are visually compared using violin plots.
- [*Kth Smallest Algorithm in C*](https://github.com/austinyu/CSC301-kth-smallest-elements) 
  - An algorithm to find the kth smallest element within an array in linear time complexity. 
  - The number of swap operations performed is visualized by scatter plot to show linear time complexity. 

-  [*Priority Queue in Java*](https://github.com/austinyu/CSC301-priority-queue)
  - Implementations of priority queue interface using both unsorted array and heap data structures.
